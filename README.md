# STA141C-FinalProject
Big Data and High Performance Computing Final Project

## Description
As part of STA 141C -- "Big Data and High Performance Computing" -- we analyzed publicly available government transaction data available through [USASpending](https://www.usaspending.gov/#/). In doing so, we hoped to better understand how government funding dedicated to two agencies, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), was distributed.
